# Black Screen Fix Summary

## The Problem
After implementing auto-login, the game would successfully login, select world, select character, but then show a black screen when entering the game.

## Root Cause
The `transition()` function in SetFieldHandler was locking graphics BEFORE starting the fadeout animation. This caused:
1. Graphics locked immediately when transition() was called
2. set_field() continued executing and changed UI state to GAME
3. The game tried to render with locked graphics = BLACK SCREEN
4. The fadeout callback (which unlocks graphics) hadn't run yet

## The Fix
Moved the graphics lock from before the fadeout to inside the fadeout callback:

```cpp
// BEFORE (causing black screen):
void SetFieldHandler::transition(...) {
    GraphicsGL::get().lock();  // Lock immediately
    Window::get().fadeout(..., callback);  // Fadeout happens later
}

// AFTER (fixed):
void SetFieldHandler::transition(...) {
    Window::get().fadeout(..., []() {
        GraphicsGL::get().lock();  // Lock only when fadeout starts
        // ... load map ...
        GraphicsGL::get().unlock();
    });
}
```

## Additional Improvements
1. Added map ID validation to prevent invalid map IDs
2. Added extensive debug logging throughout the transition process
3. Fixed indentation issues in set_field()

## Result
The game now properly:
1. Fades out while graphics are unlocked
2. Changes UI state to GAME
3. Locks graphics only during map loading
4. Unlocks graphics after map is loaded
5. Shows the game world properly

The black screen issue is resolved!
