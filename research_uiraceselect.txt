RESEARCH REQUEST: MapleStory v83/v87 UIRaceSelect Implementation

PROBLEM:
The current UIRaceSelect.cpp implementation is designed for modern MapleStory (v228+) and tries to access UI nodes that don't exist in v83/v87. The character creation screen (race selection) crashes because it's looking for "RaceSelect_new" and complex button structures that don't exist. When it does run, everything renders at position (0,0) making UI elements bunched up in the top-left corner.

AVAILABLE UI STRUCTURE (from UI_compressed.txt):
```
Login.img
 ├─ RaceSelect
 │   states:{BtSelect,aran,aran1,knight,normal,textGL}
 │   anim:{4,3,3,3,3,1}
```

This means RaceSelect has 6 different states:
- BtSelect: 4 animation frames (likely the select button)
- aran: 3 animation frames (Aran class option)
- aran1: 3 animation frames (Aran variant?)
- knight: 3 animation frames (Cygnus Knight class option)
- normal: 3 animation frames (Explorer/normal class option)
- textGL: 1 animation frame (some text element)

CURRENT BROKEN CODE STRUCTURE:
The UIRaceSelect.cpp constructor tries to access:
- RaceSelect_new (doesn't exist, should be RaceSelect)
- RaceSelect["order"][SELECTED_LIST] (doesn't exist)
- RaceSelect["make"]["pos"] (doesn't exist)
- RaceSelect["button"]["normal"], RaceSelect["buttonDisabled"] (don't exist)
- RaceSelect["Back"], RaceSelect["Back1"], RaceSelect["BackAni"] (don't exist)
- Various hotlist, newlist, bgm nodes (don't exist)

TASK:
Please analyze the v83/v87 UI structure and provide:

1. **Correct UI Node Access Pattern**: How to properly access the RaceSelect states (BtSelect, aran, knight, normal, textGL) and extract textures/sprites from them

2. **Proper Positioning Strategy**: Since position data isn't embedded in the nodes, provide:
   - Default screen positions for each class selection button
   - Proper screen layout (800x600 resolution)
   - Background positioning if any

3. **Complete UIRaceSelect Constructor Rewrite**: Provide C++ code that:
   - Correctly loads textures from the available states
   - Sets up proper button positioning
   - Maps the 3 available classes (Explorer/normal, Knight, Aran) to the UI
   - Handles the simplified v83/v87 structure

4. **Draw Method Fixes**: Update the draw() method to:
   - Only draw textures that actually exist
   - Position elements correctly on screen
   - Handle the simplified class selection UI

5. **Button Interaction**: How button clicks should work with this simplified structure

CONTEXT:
- This is for a v83/v87 MapleStory private server (Cosmic)
- Screen resolution: 800x600
- Only 3 character classes available: Explorers (normal), Cygnus Knights (knight), Aran
- User should be able to click on class icons to select them, then proceed to character creation
- No modern features like hotlist, newlist, complex backgrounds

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Complete C++ code sections that replace the broken parts of UIRaceSelect.cpp, working purely with the v83/v87 UI structure shown above.
