# Black Screen Issue Analysis - V2

## Current Status
The auto-login is now mostly working! The client successfully:
1. Auto-logs in with admin/admin
2. Auto-selects world 0, channel 0  
3. Auto-selects character 0
4. Enters the game world (map 104040000)
5. Loads the map and spawns NPCs/mobs

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Client Returns to Login Screen
After successfully entering the game, the client immediately goes back to the login screen and attempts to login again (which fails with "Already logged in" error).

From the debug log:
```
[DEBUG]: [SetFieldHandler] Fadeout callback completed successfully
[DEBUG]: [UIStateGame] pre_add() START - type=36...
[DEBUG]: [UILogin] Constructor starting...
[DEBUG]: [LoginResultHandler] Login reason code: 7
```

This suggests either:
- The client is crashing/disconnecting after entering game
- There's a state management issue causing it to reset
- The Stage is already active when trying to load, causing conflicts

### 2. Graphics/Rendering Issues
Multiple sprite creation errors:
```
[ERROR]: [Sprite] Failed to create sprite - null node
```

### 3. Map Loading Conflict
The Stage reports "Already active, skipping load" which might indicate a state management problem:
```
[DEBUG]: [Stage] load() called - mapid: 104040000, portalid: 15, current state: 2
[DEBUG]: [Stage] Already active, skipping load
```

## Root Causes

1. **State Transition Issue**: The UI state changes to GAME but something causes it to revert to LOGIN
2. **Graphics Lock Timing**: Fixed the early lock issue, but there may still be timing problems
3. **Packet Parsing**: Fixed monsterbook parsing issues, but there might be other packet structure differences for v83

## Next Steps

1. Add protection against re-login when already in game state
2. Investigate why the client is returning to login state
3. Check for any exceptions or crashes after entering game
4. Review the Stage state management to prevent conflicts
5. Add more debug logging around state transitions

## Success So Far
- Auto-login fully functional through character selection
- Packet parsing issues resolved with better error handling
- Map loading and player transfer working
- NPCs and mobs spawning correctly

The black screen is gone - we can see the game is loading! The issue now is maintaining the game state.
