# Inventory UI Freeze Investigation

## Problem Summary
The UIItemInventory constructor completes successfully, but the application's UI thread freezes immediately after. Music continues playing, indicating only the UI rendering/update thread is stuck in an infinite loop.

## Debug Evidence
```
[INVENTORY] UIItemInventory constructor completed!
[INVENTORY] Constructor about to return...
[INVENTORY] Emplace returned successfully!
[INVENTORY] UIItemInventory created successfully!
```

Then complete freeze - no draw() or update() debug messages appear.

## Key Findings
1. Constructor works perfectly - no crashes, all safety checks pass
2. emplace() returns successfully
3. UI thread hangs immediately after inventory creation
4. Music continues = only UI thread is frozen
5. Added debug counters to draw() and update() methods but they never print = freeze before first UI cycle
6. Icon loading was disabled but freeze persists = not related to inventory data access

## Investigation Focus
The freeze happens in the UI system's management of the newly created UIItemInventory element, likely during:
- UI element registration/initialization
- First draw/update cycle preparation
- Event handler setup
- Memory management of UI elements

## Files to Investigate
- UIItemInventory.cpp (constructor, draw, update methods)
- UIStateGame.cpp (emplace method and UI state management)
- UI base classes (UIElement, UIDragElement)
- UI system's element management

## Research Task
Find the root cause of the UI thread freeze that occurs immediately after UIItemInventory creation. Focus on what happens AFTER the constructor completes but BEFORE the first draw/update cycle.
