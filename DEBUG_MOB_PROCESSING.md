# Debug Mob Processing - Next Steps

## What We Know
✅ Server is sending SPAWN_MOB packets (27 packets received)
✅ PacketSwitch is receiving and logging them correctly
❓ Need to verify client-side processing

## Debug Code Added
I've added debugging to:
1. `SpawnMobHandler::handle()` - Shows when packets are processed
2. `MapMobs::spawn()` - Shows when mobs are queued
3. `MapMobs::update()` - Shows when queue is processed

## Next Test
1. **Recompile** the client with the debug changes
2. **Run** the client and connect to server
3. **Load** map 104000100 (or any map)
4. **Look for** these debug messages in console:

### Expected Output Sequence
```
[DEBUG] SpawnMobHandler::handle() called
[DEBUG] Spawning mob: OID=12345, ID=100100, pos=(500,300), stance=0, fh=1
[DEBUG] MapMobs::spawn() called, adding to queue. Queue size before: 0
[DEBUG] Spawn added to queue. Queue size after: 1
[DEBUG] Mob spawn queued successfully
... (repeat for each SPAWN_MOB packet)

[DEBUG] MapMobs::update() called, spawns queue size: 27
[DEBUG] Processing spawn from queue: OID=12345
[DEBUG] Creating new mob from spawn
[DEBUG] New mob added to map
... (repeat for each spawn in queue)
```

## What Each Message Tells Us

### ✅ If you see SpawnMobHandler messages:
- Packets are being processed by handler
- Handler is parsing mob data correctly
- Handler is calling MapMobs::spawn()

### ✅ If you see MapMobs::spawn messages:
- Spawns are being added to queue
- Queue size is growing

### ✅ If you see MapMobs::update messages:
- Game loop is calling update
- Spawns are being processed from queue
- Mobs are being created

### ❌ If you DON'T see certain messages:
- **No SpawnMobHandler messages** → Handler not being called (packet routing issue)
- **No MapMobs::spawn messages** → spawn() not being called (handler issue)
- **No MapMobs::update messages** → update() not being called (game loop issue)
- **Queue never empties** → Spawns not being processed (update issue)

## Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Handler Not Called
If you don't see SpawnMobHandler messages, the packet handler isn't being called.

### Issue 2: Update Not Called
If spawns are queued but never processed, `MapMobs::update()` isn't being called by the game loop.

### Issue 3: Mob Creation Failure
If spawns are processed but mobs don't appear, there's an issue in `spawn.instantiate()` or `mobs.add()`.

## Please Test Now
1. Compile with debug changes
2. Run client and load map
3. Copy/paste the debug output here
4. Focus on the sequence of messages

This will pinpoint exactly where the mob spawning pipeline breaks!
