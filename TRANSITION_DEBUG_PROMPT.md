# MapleStory Client Character-to-Game Transition Debug Investigation

## Problem Statement

We have a **critical transition failure** in a MapleStory v83/v87 client where the character selection to game world transition is not working properly. Here's what's happening:

### Current Behavior (BROKEN):
1. User clicks "Enter Game" button in character selection
2. Character select UI disappears (this part works now)
3. **WHITE SCREEN appears** - this is the main issue
4. The screen dimensions change (becomes taller)
5. Game world never loads properly
6. User is stuck on white screen

### Expected Behavior:
1. User clicks "Enter Game" 
2. Character select UI disappears
3. **Smooth fade transition** to game world
4. Game map loads with character, NPCs, monsters
5. Player can control their character

### Network Trace (SUCCESS - packets are working):
```

[NET] Received packet opcode: 125 (SET_FIELD), length: 617

```

**IMPORTANT**: The network communication is WORKING CORRECTLY. The server is sending SET_FIELD packet (opcode 125) which should trigger the game world transition. The issue is in the CLIENT-SIDE transition logic.

## Key Technical Context

### What We've Already Fixed:
1. ✅ **Button Multiple-Click Issue**: Fixed Enter button triggering multiple times
2. ✅ **UI Cleanup**: Character select UI now properly disappears 
3. ✅ **Character Data**: CharEntry parsing and character loading works
4. ✅ **Network Protocol**: v83/v87 packet format compatibility established

### Implementation Details:
- Using **UICharSelect_Legacy** (custom v83/v87 implementation) instead of modern UICharSelect
- Using **ViewAllChar** assets instead of CharSelect assets
- Character data parsing confirmed working (we've successfully loaded characters before)
- This is a **v83/v87 server (Cosmic)** connecting to a **v228 client** (compatibility layer working)

## Core Investigation Areas

The issue is likely in one of these areas:

### 1. **SetFieldHandler Transition Logic** (`SetFieldHandlers.cpp`)
- The `transition(mapid, portalid)` method that handles the fade and game world loading
- Window fade logic in `Window::get().fadeout()`
- Graphics clearing and locking/unlocking sequence
- Stage loading: `Stage::get().load(mapid, portalid)`

### 2. **UI State Management** (`UI.cpp`, `UIStateGame.cpp`)
- `UI::get().change_state(UI::State::GAME)` call
- UIStateGame constructor and initialization
- Potential conflict between login UI state and game UI state

### 3. **Graphics/Rendering Pipeline** (`GraphicsGL.cpp`)
- `GraphicsGL::get().clear()` calls
- Graphics locking: `GraphicsGL::get().lock()` / `unlock()`
- OpenGL context state during transition

### 4. **Stage Loading** (`Stage.cpp`)
- `Stage::get().load(mapid, portalid)` implementation
- `Stage::get().loadplayer(playerentry)` player loading
- `Stage::get().transfer_player()` player transfer
- Map data loading and rendering initialization

## Specific Questions to Investigate

1. **Graphics Pipeline**: Is the graphics context being properly reset during transition? Could there be a graphics lock/unlock mismatch causing the white screen?

2. **UI State Conflict**: Is there a conflict between the LOGIN UI state and GAME UI state during transition? Are elements from both states persisting?

3. **Window Fade Logic**: Is the fadeout/fadein sequence working properly? Could the fade be getting stuck in an intermediate state?

4. **Stage Loading Order**: Is the stage loading sequence (clear → load → transfer) happening in the right order? Could there be a race condition?

5. **OpenGL Context**: Could there be an OpenGL rendering state issue where the screen is being cleared but new content isn't being drawn?

## Investigation Approach

Please analyze the provided code files and:

1. **Trace the execution flow** from `SetFieldHandler::set_field()` through the complete transition sequence
2. **Identify potential failure points** where the transition could get stuck
3. **Look for graphics/rendering issues** that could cause a white screen
4. **Check UI state management** for conflicts or incomplete transitions
5. **Suggest specific debugging steps** or code fixes

## Files Provided

The `repomix_transition_debug.txt` contains focused files related to the transition:
- `SetFieldHandlers.cpp` - Main transition handler
- `UICharSelect_Legacy.cpp` - Character selection implementation  
- `UIState*.cpp` - UI state management
- `UI.cpp/UI.h` - Core UI system
- `Stage.cpp` - Game world loading
- `Window.cpp` - Window management
- `GraphicsGL.cpp` - Graphics/OpenGL management

Focus your investigation on the **transition sequence** and **rendering pipeline** as the most likely culprits for the white screen issue.
